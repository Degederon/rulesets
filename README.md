Deges Sample RuleSets

Hi There this is Dege,
The House Rule mod is a real "game" changer as you can create your own game. It customizes your gameplay style to be
very easy to the exceptionally crazy hard. In this repository we add rulesets that we have played and perhaps you 
would like to try it out too!

Added rulesets require House Rules. If you have rule sets that you would like us to list and include for others to
enjoy, please send them to Demeo@epomd.com. Be sure to add some comments about how many players, if your a Guardian, 
Bard etc and any added comments.  

Have fun gaming!

Dege
